Subject: use case on SUV buying behaviour using support vector machines <br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
We have been given a problem on Support Vector Machines and the objective of the case study is to predict if the user is going to buy an
SUV. We first load the dataset and then carry out data exploration. We take a peek at the data, study descriptive statistics, class 
distribution and corrlation between attributes. We further explore the data and then carry out data visualization using univariate 
(histogram, density and box and whisker) plots and multivariate (scatter plot matrix and correlation matrix) plots. We then split the 
data into train and test data and then instantiate an SVM model and fit the data. We predict the values and plot the confusion matrix.
